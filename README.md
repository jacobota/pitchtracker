# Pitch Tracker

Author: Jacob Ota

Description: This app is designed to help coaches and players jot down notes and understand tendencies of pitchers and hitters that they choose to track. Some features include heat maps of where a pitcher locates pitches most/least often and where a hitter has a higher/lower batting average, and showing batting averages against pitchers and for hitters on fastball or off-speed pitches. First time developing with React.
